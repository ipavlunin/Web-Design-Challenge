# Weather Web Visualization Dashboard

Data is more powerful when we share it with others!

![Landing Page](Images/Land_Page_Large.png)


For this project I'll be creating a visualization dashboard website. Specifically, I'll be plotting weather data for the following list of cities [weather data](WebViz/Resources/cities.csv).

Building this dashboard, I'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. 

### Website Structure

Website published on GitHub Pages: [Weather Dashboard]()

The Weather Dashboard contains the following pages:
- [Latitude](index.html)
    - The main project page displaying a summary of the project and vizualization links
- [Max Temperature](WebViz/max_temp.html)
    - Page dispaying vizualization for max temperature and links to other related website pages
- [Humidity](WebViz/humidity.html)
    - Page dispaying vizualization for humidity and links to other related website pages
- [Cloudiness](WebViz/cloudiness.html)
    - Page dispaying vizualization for cloudiness and links to other related website pages
- [Wind Speed](WebVix/wind_speed.html)
    - Page dispaying vizualization for wind speed and links to other related website pages
- [Comparison](WebViz/comparison.html)
    - Page dispaying all vizualizationa together. Clicking on each vizualisation will lead to correspondent vizualization page
- [Data](WebViz/data.html)
    - Page dispaying the source of tabular data used in the project
